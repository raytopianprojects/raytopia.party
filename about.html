                <p> Hi we're Raytopia and we make a lot of random things. 
                    <br><br>Things like software, games, videos, worldbuilding, and much more.
                    <br><br>Sometimes our projects turn out well sometimes they don't.
                    <br><br>Because we love Free Culture and think it should be more wide spread the projects will be put under Copyleft.
                </p>
